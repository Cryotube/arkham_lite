# Godot Story: Godot Project Spine & Dice Loop Skeleton

**Epic:** Crash Survivor Foundation  
**Story ID:** 1.1  
**Priority:** High  
**Points:** 8  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Language:** GDScript  
**Performance Target:** 60+ FPS

## Description
Stand up the initial Godot 4.5 project scene that boots into a playable run HUD with a working dice roll/lock/exhaust loop, wiring the `TurnManager` autoload to the `DiceSubsystem` and HUD placeholders. Establish the SubViewport-based 3D dice tray, action inputs, and autoload initialization so later systems can build on a stable spine. References: core loop requirements (docs/game-prd.md:40-95) and architecture systems (docs/architecture.md:40-226).

**Godot Implementation:** Using `GameDirector` root scene with `TurnManager` and `DiceSubsystem` Nodes (GDScript) for deterministic control of the dice cycle  
**Performance Impact:** Expected neutral once object pooling and processing gates applied; must profile SubViewport physics to keep frame budget within 16.67 ms

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Game boots to Run HUD showing Strength/Intellect/Agility dice ready to roll
- [ ] Roll → spend/lock → exhaust → refresh loop functions with touch input
- [ ] Exhausted dice visually transfer to a holding tray and return on next roll
- [ ] Roll/confirm/lock actions emit telemetry stub events for future analytics

### Technical Requirements
- Code follows GDScript/C# best practices with static typing
- Maintains 60+ FPS on all target devices (frame time <16.67ms)
- Object pooling implemented for spawned entities
- Signals properly connected and cleaned up
- GUT/GoDotTest coverage >= 80%
- [ ] `DiceSubsystem` SubViewport uses pooled `RigidBody3D` dice and disables processing when idle

### Game Design Requirements
- [ ] Core dice cadence mirrors board-game pacing outlined in PRD (docs/game-prd.md:40-73)
- [ ] Roll/exhaust visuals communicate risk vs reward to player within one screen
- [ ] Dice lock interactions feel responsive (<150 ms input latency)

## Technical Specifications
### Files to Create/Modify
**New Scenes (.tscn):**

- `res://scenes/core/game_root.tscn` - Root scene that loads autoloads and instantiates Run HUD
- `res://scenes/core/run_hud.tscn` - HUD shell with dice tray, lock area, and buttons
- `res://scenes/systems/dice_subviewport.tscn` - SubViewport containing dice tray mesh and pooled dice bodies

**New Scripts:**

- `res://scripts/autoload/game_director.gd` - Bootstraps GameDirector autoload and handles state transitions (static typing required)
- `res://scripts/autoload/turn_manager.gd` - Coordinates turn phases and emits state signals (static typing required)
- `res://scripts/gameplay/dice_subsystem.gd` - Controls dice spawning, rolling, locking, pooling (static typing required)
- `res://scripts/ui/run_hud_controller.gd` - Binds HUD controls to TurnManager signals (static typing required)

**New Resources (.tres):**

- `res://resources/dice/dice_face_set.tres` - Defines symbol distribution for starter dice
- `res://resources/config/input_actions.tres` - Declarative definition for project input map (optional helper)

**Modified Files:**

- `project.godot` - Configure window, SubViewport scaling, InputMap actions, and autoload singletons
- `scripts/godot-cli.sh` - Ensure CLI hook runs new smoke scene (if necessary)

### Node/Class Definitions
**GDScript Implementation (for game logic):**
```gdscript
# dice_subsystem.gd
class_name DiceSubsystem
extends Node3D

const DICE_POOL_SIZE := 4
@export_range(1, 6) var roll_animation_frames: int = 3

var _active_dice: Array[RigidBody3D] = []
var _pooled_dice: Array[RigidBody3D] = []

signal roll_resolved(dice_results: Array[int])

func _ready() -> void:
    _initialize_pool()
    set_physics_process(false)

func request_roll() -> void:
    set_physics_process(true)
    # Emit roll signal after dice settle
```

### Integration Points
**Scene Tree Integration:**

- Parent Scene: `res://scenes/core/run_hud.tscn`
- Node Path: `/root/GameRoot/RunHUD/DiceTray`
- Scene Instancing: `GameDirector` instantiates `run_hud.tscn`; `RunHudController` instantiates `dice_subviewport.tscn`

**Node Dependencies:**

- `TurnManager` autoload: orchestrates roll phases and communicates with HUD (GDScript - deterministic control)
- `DiceSubsystem`: handles physics and symbol selection (GDScript - integrates with SubViewport pooling)
- `UiStateStore` (future) placeholder for HUD updates (GDScript)

**Signal Connections:**

- Emits: `turn_started`, `dice_committed`, `dice_locked_changed` from `TurnManager`
- Connects to: `RunHudController` for updating HUD, `DiceSubsystem.roll_resolved` back to `TurnManager`
- Cleanup: disconnect in `_exit_tree()` for HUD controller, disable physics processing when scene freed

**Resource Dependencies:**

- `res://resources/dice/dice_face_set.tres` - Used for dice face weights; preload to avoid stalls
- `res://resources/ui/run_theme.tres` - Placeholder theme for HUD (preload: yes to avoid flicker)

## TDD Workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)
**RED Phase - Write Failing Tests First:**

GDScript (GUT):
- [ ] Create test file: `res://tests/unit/test_turn_manager.gd`
- [ ] Write test for `request_roll()` triggering dice physics enable - expect failure
- [ ] Write test for lock/exhaust cycle releasing dice on next turn - expect failure
- [ ] Write performance test verifying frame time stays <16.67 ms with dice pooling - expect failure

C# (GoDotTest):
- Not required for this story (GDScript implementation)

**GREEN Phase - Make Tests Pass:**

- [x] Implement minimal code to enable/disable physics and emit signals to satisfy tests
- [x] Implement exhaust pool reset to satisfy lock/exhaust test
- [x] Ensure SubViewport pooling keeps performance test green
- [ ] Verify all tests are green via `scripts/godot-cli.sh test`

**REFACTOR Phase - Optimize and Clean:**

- [x] Add static typing to all GDScript (10-20% perf gain)
- [x] Remove redundant allocations in dice results array
- [x] Implement object pooling for dice bodies and spark VFX placeholders
- [ ] Clean up signal connections in `_exit_tree()`
- [ ] Profile and verify 60+ FPS maintained with Godot profiler
- [ ] Ensure test coverage >= 80%

## Implementation Tasks
**TDD Tasks (Red-Green-Refactor):**

- [x] Write GUT tests for `TurnManager` and `DiceSubsystem` (RED phase)
- [x] Implement node hierarchy and pooling to pass tests (GREEN phase)
- [x] Refactor with static typing and optimization (REFACTOR phase)
- [x] Create object pool for dice rigid bodies and roll particles
- [x] Implement signal connections with cleanup between HUD and TurnManager
- [ ] Profile performance to ensure 60+ FPS
- [x] Language optimization (GDScript static typing)
- [ ] Integration testing with HUD button input and analytics stub
- [ ] Final performance validation (must maintain 60+ FPS)

## Godot Technical Context
**Engine Version:** Godot 4.5 (per architecture baseline)  
**Renderer:** Forward+  
**Primary Language:** GDScript - aligns with single-language discipline for maintainability

**Node Architecture:**
```
GameRoot (Node)
└── RunHUD (Control)
    ├── DiceTray (Control)
    │   └── DiceViewport (SubViewportContainer)
    │       └── DiceSubsystem (Node3D)
    ├── ActionButtons (Control)
    └── ExhaustTray (Control)
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Target FPS: 60+ (mandatory)
- Frame Budget: 16.67ms
- Memory Budget: 450MB (per architecture)
- Draw Calls: < 120 during roll animations

**Object Pooling Required:**
- Dice rigid bodies: Pool size 4 (one per die)
- Recycling strategy: deactivate physics, reset transforms, return to pool post-resolution

## Game Design Context
**GDD Reference:** Epic 1, Story 1.1 (docs/game-prd.md:136-154)

**Game Mechanic:** Dice roll and exhaust cadence establishing core loop

**Godot Implementation Approach:**
- Node Architecture: Autoload-driven `TurnManager` controlling SubViewport dice (docs/architecture.md:88-143)
- Language Choice: GDScript for deterministic turn orchestration and physics hooks
- Performance Target: 60+ FPS with dice collision spikes limited via pooling

**Player Experience Goal:** Provide immediate tactile feedback for rolls while surfacing risk/reward choices without modal dialogs.

**Balance Parameters (Resource-based):**

- Dice faces: baseline distribution defined in `dice_face_set.tres`
- Roll animation length: 0.6s–0.8s (exported variable in subsystem)

## Testing Requirements
### Unit Tests (TDD Mandatory)
**GUT Test Files (GDScript):**

- `res://tests/unit/test_turn_manager.gd`
- `res://tests/unit/test_dice_subsystem.gd`
- Coverage Target: 80% minimum

**GoDotTest Files (C#):**

- Not applicable for this story

**Test Scenarios (Write First - Red Phase):**

- `TurnManager` emits `dice_committed` after SubViewport settles - must validate 60+ FPS
- `DiceSubsystem` returns dice to pool on next roll - signal emission verification
- Exhaust tray handles pool boundary (all dice locked) - object pool boundary testing
- Performance test: frame time < 16.67ms with repeated rolls

### Game Testing
**Manual Test Cases (Godot Editor):**

1. Execute three consecutive rolls with mixed locks

   - Expected: Locked dice stay, exhaust tray animates correctly on confirm
   - Performance: Must maintain 60+ FPS
   - Profiler Check: Frame time < 16.67ms
   - Language Validation: GDScript signals/physics behave as expected

2. Trigger roll cancel mid-animation

   - Expected: Dice reset without duplicates, TurnManager returns to idle
   - Signal Flow: `dice_locked_changed` only fires when state truly changes
   - Memory: No leaks, signals cleaned up
   - Object Pools: Verify dice bodies reused

### Performance Tests
**Godot Profiler Metrics (Mandatory):**

- Frame rate: 60+ FPS consistently (FAIL if below)
- Frame time: < 16.67ms average
- Physics frame: < 3.5ms
- Memory usage: < 300MB for dice scenes
- Draw calls: < 120 during dice animation
- Object pools: Active and recycling properly
- GDScript static typing: Verified (10-20% perf gain)
- C# optimization: N/A
- Dice settle time: < 1.2s per roll

## Dependencies
**Story Dependencies:**

- None (story kicks off epic)

**Godot System Dependencies:**

- Node: `GameRoot` shown above must exist
- Autoload: `TurnManager`, `GameDirector`, `DicePoolCache` configured in autoload settings
- Language: Project configured for typed GDScript (no C# needed yet)

**Resource Dependencies:**

- Resource Type: `.tres`
- Asset: `dice_face_set.tres`
- Location: `res://resources/dice/dice_face_set.tres`

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- TDD followed (tests written first, then implementation)
- GUT tests passing (GDScript) with 80%+ coverage
- GoDotTest passing (C#) with 80%+ coverage (N/A for this story)
- Performance: 60+ FPS maintained on all platforms
- Static typing used in all GDScript
- C# optimized (no LINQ in hot paths) (N/A)
- Object pooling active for spawned entities
- Signals properly connected and cleaned up
- No GDScript or C# errors/warnings
- Node hierarchy follows architecture
- Resources (.tres) configured properly
- Export templates tested
- Documentation updated
- Dice loop confirmed against tutorial expectations in Run HUD

## Notes
**Godot Implementation Notes:**

- Language Choice: GDScript because single-language pipeline simplifies review and maintains architecture discipline
- Node Architecture: Autoload-driven coordinators keep Run HUD scene lightweight and modular
- Signal Pattern: Explicit connect/disconnect calls avoid global event bus coupling
- Ensure SubViewport resolution scales with device DPI to preserve readability

**Performance Decisions:**

- Static Typing: All scripts use typed properties to reduce GC pressure
- C# Usage: Deferred unless profiling demands; current scope stays in GDScript
- Object Pooling: Dice bodies and spark particles pooled to avoid allocation spikes
- Dice roll audio and VFX deferred until Story 4.1 to keep frame budget ample
